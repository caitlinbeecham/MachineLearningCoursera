# MachineLearningCoursera
programming assigments for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course
to run the relevant files one need only run ex1, ex2, ex3, ex4, etc...
these files call all other needed methods defined in other files
(have gotten 100/100 on all so far, a week ahead of schedule so far halfway through)
